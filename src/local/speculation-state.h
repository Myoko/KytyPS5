// The speculative translation of the calling thread (KYTY_SPECULATE, docs/PARALLEL-TRANSLATION.md), as the caches
// see it. A speculation records the GPU work of a graphics command buffer into its own command buffers without
// changing what other translations see: what the work needs from the shared caches is noted here and done when the
// translation is committed, in guest order, before its command buffers are submitted (uploads of the ranges it
// reads, page-table preparation for its BDA reads), or after them (the ranges it writes become GPU-owned, image
// layouts, guest memory writes of the command processor). Its own later decisions see those notes (a range it will
// upload counts as clean, one it writes as GPU-modified, an image as its work left it).
//
// A packet whose translation needs more (a buffer or image to create, a texture to upload, a program to compile,
// the normal path) is refused (Refuse). A draw or dispatch the speculation cannot take becomes a hole: the work
// recorded so far is a segment, the commit translates the packet the normal way between it and the next segment.
// At any other refused packet the speculation stops; what it recorded before is committed and the command buffer is
// translated on from there.
